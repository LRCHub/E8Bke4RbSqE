Bound to the void
Somewhere below
Beyond distant shores
One's hatred will grow

Follow the stream (follow the stream)
Dark lights ahead (dark lights ahead)
Into someone's realm (someone's realm)
Awareness is dead (awareness is dead)

Bound to the void (bound to the void)
Somewhere below (somewhere below)
Beyond distant shores (distant shores)
One's hatred will grow (hatred will grow)

Follow the stream (follow the stream)
Dark lights ahead (dark lights ahead)
Into someone's realm (someone's realm)
Awareness is dead

Down to the ground
Down to my purgatory
Face the unknown
Lost in this territory

Bound to the void (bound to the void)
Somewhere below (somewhere below)
Beyond distant shores (distant shores)
One's hatred will grow (hatred will grow)

Follow the stream (follow the stream)
Dark lights ahead (dark lights ahead)
Into someone's realm (someone's realm)
Awareness is dead (awareness is dead)

I, I am bound to the void
And I'm burning inside
Set me free

And I will beat it all
So vengeance will crawl
Set me free

I will find him alone
I will take the crown

Embraced by the sea of gloom
Darkness is crawling
Deep into the underworld
The surface is fading

Embraced by the sea of gloom
Darkness is crawling
Deep into the underworld
The surface is fading

Away from the storms above
And into the water
Frost reflections everywhere
Illusions of madness

I, I am bound to the void
And I'm burning inside
Set me free

And I will beat it all
So vengeance will crawl
Set me free

I will find him alone
I will take the crown

Embraced by the sea of gloom
Darkness is crawling
Deep into the underworld
The surface is fading

Away from the storms above
And into the water
Frost reflections everywhere
Illusions of madness

Embraced by the sea of gloom
Darkness is crawling (follow the stream)
Deep into the underworld
The surface is fading (fading away)

Away from the storms above
And into the water (somewhere)
Frost reflections everywhere
Illusions of madness (hatred)

Embraced by the sea of gloom
Darkness is crawling (dark days are here)
Deep into the underworld
The surface is fading (fading away)

Away from the storms above
And into the water
Frost reflections everywhere
Illusions of madness

Darkness is crawling
The surface is fading away
